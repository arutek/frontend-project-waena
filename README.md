## Usage

Highly recomended using `yarn` as package manager, but any other package manager like `NPM` and `PNPM` will work just fine. to install the proejct, use the following command

```bash
# Using yarn (highly recommended)
$ yarn

# Using npm
$ npm install

# Using pnpm install
$ pnpm install
```

After installation has been finished, use the following command to start development server

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn dev

# Using npm
$ npm run dev

# Using pnpm
$ pnpm run dev
```

To build this app for production use, please use the following command

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn build

# Using npm
$ npm run build

# Using pnpm
$ pnpm run build
```

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!<br>
You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
